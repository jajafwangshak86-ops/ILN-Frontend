## Mainnet Launch Readiness: Dark-Feature Re-enablement

These runbooks define the step-by-step sequence for safely re-enabling each feature that ships dark at mainnet launch. Each runbook covers the readiness gate, flag flip, smoke test, visual regression check, and rollback plan, and cross-links the corresponding backend readiness work. All three features require both frontend and backend gates to be complete before the flag is flipped.
