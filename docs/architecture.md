# Frontend Architecture Overview

This document describes the current structure, data flow, and library choices for the Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN) frontend. It is intentionally concise: enough context for contributors to understand where changes belong without duplicating implementation details from every route.

## `next.config.ts` Production-Build Audit

Reviewed 2026-08-26. Every setting confirmed intentional for production builds.

| Setting             | Value                        | Production behaviour                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reactStrictMode`   | `true`                       | Enables double-render checks in dev only; inert in prod                                                   |
| `turbopack`         | `{}`                         | Only activates during `next dev`; ignored by `next build`                                                 |
| `allowedDevOrigins` | `['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']` | **Dev-only** — Next.js ignores this in production builds (only checked during `next dev` WebSocket setup) |
| `headers()`         | CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.   | Applied to every route in both dev and prod                                                               |
| `redirects()`       | Legacy URL mappings          | Applied in both dev and prod. All `permanent: true` (308)                                                 |
| `withPWA()`         | Service worker config        | Active in prod via `next-pwa`. `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim` for fast SW activation                      |

**Conclusion:** No dev-only configuration leaks into production. `allowedDevOrigins` is explicitly a dev-only Next.js feature.

## Data-Fetching Architecture & React Query Caching

All remote asynchronous data-fetching in the frontend is consolidated into custom React Query hooks under `src/hooks/queries/` and `src/hooks/`. For the complete architecture guidelines, query key rules, mutation patterns, and exception criteria, see the dedicated **[Data-Fetching Architecture Guide](data-fetching-architecture.md)**.

Reviewed 2026-08-26 (updated 2026-09-25). All contract/Horizon queries use centralised key factories (`src/hooks/queries/keys.ts`) and configured timings (`QUERY_TIMINGS`).

| Query             | Key                               | staleTime | gcTime  | Notes                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Invoice list      | `invoiceKeys.all`                 | 15s       | 5m      | Changes often via events |
| Invoice detail    | `invoiceKeys.detail(id)`          | 30s       | 5m      |                          |
| Invoice count     | `invoiceKeys.count`               | 30s       | 5m      | Homepage ticker          |
| Protocol stats    | `statsKeys.all`                   | 60s       | 10m     | Expensive to compute     |
| Parameter updates | `governanceKeys.parameterUpdates` | 5m        | 30m     | Slow-moving              |
| Protocol status   | `protocolKeys.status`             | 15s       | 5m      | Polled every 30s         |
| Admin actions     | `adminKeys.actionHistory`         | 30s       | 5m      | Audit log                |
| Protocol feed     | `PROTOCOL_FEED_QUERY_KEY`         | 55s       | default | Polling-based            |
| Referral stats    | `['referral-stats', code]`        | default   | default | Per-user, low volume     |

**Findings:**

- All queries use `invoiceKeys.*` / `statsKeys.*` / `governanceKeys.*` / `protocolKeys.*` / `adminKeys.*` factories — no orphaned inline keys
- `QUERY_TIMINGS` centralises staleTime/gcTime — no hardcoded timings outside hooks
- React Query's built-in deduplication handles sibling components sharing the same key
- `useReferralStats` is the only hook without explicit timings (acceptable for low-frequency per-user data)

**Expected call-count reduction:** ~30% on governance pages (parameterUpdates now cached 5m vs. previously uncached). Invoice list deduplication already working via shared `invoiceKeys.all` key.

## System Shape

ILN is a Next.js App Router frontend for a Stellar/Soroban invoice liquidity protocol. The UI is organized around the protocol's main actors: freelancers submit invoices, liquidity providers fund them, payers settle or dispute them, governance users vote on proposals, and admins monitor protocol health.

## Route Surface

The primary route tree lives in `app/`. `/analytics` is the authenticated freelancer analytics workspace, while `/stats` is the public protocol-wide reporting page; `/leaderboard` is the canonical public cross-role ranking page. For the complete overview of canonical routes, purposes, primary consumers, and active redirects, refer to the [Route Map](route-map.md).

A small legacy `src/app/` tree still exists for older route experiments/tests and should be treated carefully when moving code.

Admin authorization (`/admin`, `/admin/flags` gated on the governance admin wallet, `/admin/actions` intentionally public) is enforced client-side with on-chain contract enforcement for writes; the full mechanism and its boundary are documented in the [Route Map](route-map.md) ("Admin Route Authorization"), with regression tests described in [testing.md](testing.md).

Type-safety posture for the codebase (before/after `as any` metrics, strictness flags, lint gate) is consolidated in the [type-safety report](type-safety-report.md).

## Data Flow

### Reads

Most contract and indexer reads flow through hooks:

1. A route or component calls a hook such as `useInvoices`, `useBalances`, `useContractStats`, `useRecentProtocolFeed`, or a hook under `src/hooks/queries/`.
2. The hook uses TanStack React Query for loading state, cache keys, refetch intervals, and invalidation.
3. Contract reads call `src/utils/soroban.ts` or `src/lib/*` helpers to simulate Soroban reads, parse XDR/ScVal data, query Horizon, or call an indexer endpoint.
4. Components receive typed data and render tables, cards, charts, badges, and dashboards.

### Writes

User-approved contract writes coordinate wallet state, transaction builders, and toasts:

1. The user triggers an action such as submit, fund, pay, mark paid, cancel, dispute, vote, delegate, or transfer.
2. A hook or utility builds and simulates the Soroban transaction.
3. `WalletContext` requests a Freighter signature and verifies the configured Stellar network.
4. The signed XDR is submitted and polled until resolution.
5. Sonner toasts communicate pending/success/error states, and React Query invalidates affected invoice, balance, stats, or governance queries.

### Server Routes

API routes are used for server-only integration points:

- `app/api/reminders/route.ts` reads Supabase reminder preferences and sends Resend emails when authorized by `CRON_SECRET`.
- `app/api/reminders/unsubscribe/route.ts` updates reminder preferences.
- `app/api/feedback/route.ts` can create GitHub issues from app feedback when GitHub credentials are configured.
- `app/api/notifications/[address]/route.ts` bridges notification reads by address.
- `app/api/leaderboard/route.ts` bridges leaderboard reads for `TopFundersWidget`.
- All of the above validate their inputs (Stellar address shape, allow-listed enum values, string/length limits) and apply a shared in-memory rate limiter from `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`, since each is a directly reachable server endpoint independent of any client-side validation.
- Contributor references for these server integrations live in [docs/supabase-setup.md](supabase-setup.md), [docs/feature-flags.md](feature-flags.md), [docs/api-routes.md](api-routes.md), and [docs/testing.md](testing.md).

## State, Providers, and UI Boundaries

- `app/Providers.tsx` wires global providers, React Query, theme behavior, toasts, and local MSW startup when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCKING=enabled`.
- `WalletContext` owns wallet address, provider state, network checks, role detection, balances, and signing.
- `NotificationContext` stores in-app notification history.
- `ToastContext` wraps toast behavior while `AppToaster` renders the Sonner host.
- `KeyboardShortcutsContext` manages keyboard shortcut state and global keydown listeners.
- Page routes should compose feature components and hooks; reusable components should stay under `src/components/`.
- Stellar SDK and RPC details should stay in `src/utils/soroban.ts`, `src/lib/`, or focused hooks rather than being called directly from presentational components. Integration status of live vs. stubbed contract details are tracked in [docs/contract-integration-status.md](contract-integration-status.md).

### Context vs Hooks Boundary

- **`src/context/`** — React Context providers and their consumer hooks (e.g., `WalletProvider` + `useWallet`,
  `ToastProvider` + `useToast`, `NotificationProvider` + `useNotification`,
  `KeyboardShortcutsProvider` + `useKeyboardShortcuts`). Context files own _shared global state_ that must
  be available to the entire subtree. If a file exports a `*Provider` or calls `createContext`, it belongs here.

- **`src/hooks/`** — Custom React hooks that do NOT define new contexts. They may consume context hooks
  to derive or transform state, manage local (component-level) state, wrap external APIs, or encapsulate
  effect-heavy logic. If a file exports only hook functions (that consume context or are pure utilities),
  it belongs here.

### Naming Conventions

- `useToast` — always imported from `@/context/ToastContext` (the former re-export `@/hooks/useToast` has been removed).
- `useWallet` — always imported from `@/context/WalletContext` for basic wallet state.
- `useNotification` (singular) — always imported from `@/context/NotificationContext` for in-app notification items.
- `useBrowserNotifications` (plural) — imported from `@/hooks/useBrowserNotifications` for the browser Notification API (permissions, desktop notifications).

### Avoiding Duplicate Polling & State

Invoice status changes are the primary source of duplication risk. To keep RPC usage predictable:

1. **React Query is the single source of truth** for contract reads. Hooks should prefer `useQuery`-based data
   over direct contract calls to avoid bypassing cache and creating redundant network requests.
2. **Notification polling** (`useNotificationEvents`, `usePositionPolling`) should share a single
   invoice-change detection loop. Do not add a third polling hook that independently calls `getInvoice()`.
3. **LocalStorage-derived state** (bookmarks, watchlist, address book, LP settings, widget layout)
   is acceptable per-hook, but state computations should not duplicate logic already present in context providers.

## Service Worker Security Model

`next-pwa` generates `public/sw.js` and the `public/workbox-*.js` runtime from the `runtimeCaching` list in
`next.config.ts`. Because the service worker can serve cached responses on repeat visits without hitting the
network, it is a longer-lived attack surface than a single page load and is documented here explicitly.

- **Precache integrity**: every build-time asset in the Workbox precache manifest (the `self.__WB_MANIFEST`
  array injected into `sw.js`) is keyed by a content-hash `revision`. If a build artifact changes, its
  revision/URL changes too, so a stale or tampered precached file cannot silently masquerade as the current
  one - the manifest itself is only trustworthy to the extent that `sw.js` was delivered over HTTPS from the
  real origin in the first place. There is no additional signing layer on top of this; Vercel's per-deploy
  immutable static hosting is the trust root for that initial delivery.
- **`skipWaiting: true` + `clientsClaim: true`**: a newly installed service worker activates immediately and
  takes control of already-open tabs, instead of waiting for every tab to close. This intentionally shortens
  the window during which a stale worker (e.g. one associated with a previously shipped, now-patched bug)
  keeps serving old cached responses. The trade-off is that a new worker version rolls out fast to every open
  tab - which is also why the runtime-cached entries below use short, bounded `maxAgeSeconds`/`maxEntries`
  windows rather than long-lived caching, so the blast radius of any single bad response is capped even in
  the worst case.
- **`cacheableResponse` filtering**: the `api-cache`, `pages`, and static-asset runtime caching entries only
  persist responses with status `0` (opaque, same-origin no-cors) or `200`. Error responses, redirects, and
  other non-success statuses are never written into the cache, so a transient 4xx/5xx from a misbehaving or
  MITM'd endpoint cannot be replayed to the user as if it were a valid cached page or API response.
- **Scope of trust**: the service worker cannot protect against a compromised build pipeline or a
  same-origin MITM that serves an attacker-controlled `sw.js` directly (this is a browser platform limitation
  shared by all Workbox-based PWAs, not specific to this app). The mitigations above bound how long any single
  bad response can persist and ensure a new deploy supersedes the previous worker quickly; they do not replace
  transport security (HTTPS, HSTS) or build/deploy integrity, which remain the primary controls.
- **No mutating requests are cached**: `runtimeCaching` strategies only intercept `GET` requests by default,
  so `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` calls (e.g. reminder opt-in writes) always go to the network and are never served
  from, or written to, the service worker cache.

## Environment Model

The canonical local template is `.env.local.example`. Direct env references in `app/` and `src/` are checked by:

```bash
pnpm run env:check
```

The CI workflow runs the same command, and `.env.local.example.allowlist` documents runtime-provided values such as `NODE_ENV`.

Client-visible configuration uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, including Stellar network settings, feature flags, indexer URLs, WalletConnect project ID, app URL/version, and contract version labels. Server-only secrets such as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, and GitHub feedback credentials must never be exposed with a public prefix.

## Backend Service Dependency Map

The frontend depends on multiple backend services with varying criticality levels. This map documents each dependency, its purpose, impact of degradation, and resilience strategy.

| Service                   | Purpose                                                                | Criticality             | Degradation Impact                                                             | Resilience Strategy                                                                                           | Cross-Reference                             |

### Service Health Monitoring

Each blocking and degraded-gracefully service is monitored via:

- Scheduled synthetic integration health checks covering end-to-end data flow
- Deploy-triggered smoke tests verifying basic connectivity
- Smart-contract canary transactions for on-chain health

See docs/monitoring-runbook.md for monitoring strategy and incident response procedures.

### Resilience Implementation Notes

**React Query Cache as Primary Resilience Layer**: Most backend service degradations are handled by React Query's staleTime and gcTime configuration, allowing the UI to serve cached data while displaying staleness indicators.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core read flows work with degraded backends by serving cached or simplified data. Write flows require healthy Soroban RPC and Horizon but provide clear error states when unavailable.

**User Communication**: All degradation scenarios surface user-visible status through IndexerUnavailableNotice, NetworkMismatchBanner, OfflineBanner, or toast notifications rather than silent failures.

## Library Rationale

- **Next.js App Router**: Fits route-level product areas, server API routes, PWA/offline behavior, and deployable static/client-heavy surfaces.
- **TanStack React Query**: Provides structured cache keys, query invalidation after wallet transactions, polling controls for live protocol state, and optimistic update patterns.
- **i18next, react-i18next, and next-intl**: Support existing locale files and leave room for route-aware internationalized UI.
- **next-pwa**: Generates the service worker and offline support used by `app/offline/` and public PWA assets.
- **next-themes**: Keeps theme state centralized for the light/dark design system.
- **Sonner**: Gives mutation flows concise pending/success/error toast updates without heavyweight styling.
- **Supabase JS and Resend**: Power opt-in payer reminder persistence and email delivery behind server-only env gates.
- **Recharts**: Used for stats, analytics, yield, reputation, allocation, and volume visualizations.
- **jspdf, papaparse, qrcode, and qrcode.react**: Cover invoice PDF generation, CSV import/export support, and invoice sharing flows.
- **Storybook, Chromatic, Vitest, Playwright, jest-axe, and Stryker**: Cover component documentation, visual regression, unit/accessibility tests, browser journeys, and mutation testing.

## Contributor Guidance

When adding a route, update this document and the README route summary if the product surface changes. When adding an env var, update `.env.local.example` or `.env.local.example.allowlist` in the same change and run `pnpm run env:check`.

The frontend has no GraphQL layer: reads go through the REST, Soroban RPC, Horizon, Supabase, and indexer paths described in [Data Flow](#data-flow). GraphQL is deferred until after mainnet; the decision and re-entry criteria are recorded in [docs/graphql-query-guidelines.md](graphql-query-guidelines.md).
